### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lei Li, a PhD student at the University of Hong Kong, co-supervised by Prof. [Lingpeng Kong](https://ikekonglp.github.io/) and Prof. [Qi Liu](https://leuchine.github.io/). I completed my masterâ€™s degree at Peking University as a member of [Lanco](https://lancopku.github.io/), advised by Prof. [Xu Sun](https://xusun.org), and my bachelorâ€™s degree at Xidian University.

My current research interests lie in developing multi-modal LLMs and understanding the emerging capabilities of LLMs.
