### Hi there 👋

I'm Lei Li, a final-year master student at Peking University, advised by Prof. [Xu SUN](https://xusun.org).

Currently, I am very interested in Natural Language Processing, especially improving the efficiency of pre-trained language models and exploring fundamental problems in multi-modal learning.
